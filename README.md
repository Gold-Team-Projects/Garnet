# Garnet-Network
A CDN-WAN hybrid chat network.
## Concept
**Garnet** is a hybrid chat network modeled after the internet. It relies on a **C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etwork (also called a CDN) of 
**G**arnet **A**ddress and **S**ervice **P**roviders (also called GASPs). 

## Implementation
Garnet is a network in which any third party client can connect. The Garnet Standard Client will be coming soon.

The GASP software is available in the `GASP` folder.
